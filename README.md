# 3DQ-Park
Presenting a novel Reinforcement Learning method on a proposed Unifying Equation (Just one Kinematic Equation for Parking (Parallel (both side of street), Vertical, Oblique) + Overtaking)

This project only showcase its capability for both-side parking with 3D Fully Mechanical Simulation with Webots!

All the source code will be piblic after journal publication of 3DQ Series.

Cheers!
